# retro64-builder
A GUI tool for compiling the Retro64 DLL file. Executable download can be found [here](https://github.com/Retro64Mod/retro64-GUI-build-utility/releases).
# Introduction
This is a GUI tool forked from the [PC Port Build utility](https://github.com/ajohns6/sm64-pcport-GUI-build-utility) to aid those who are unfamiliar and/or intimidated by utilzing a terminal-based interface. This simple GUI tool will perform the majority of setup required to retreive build dependencies and repository updates, complete the build itself, and even open up a window directly to the newly compiled DLL.

 
# Prerequisites
While the compiling process itself can be as simple as a single click of a button, there are two requirements prior to utilizing the tool:
1. .NET 4.7.2 Runtime. This can be downloaded at https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472.
2. Install and update MSYS2. Download and directions can be found at https://www.msys2.org/.

# Features
The build tool in general requires little in way of instructions as if you want to simply play a simple, vanilla port of the original game on PC, all you have to do is place baserom.us.z64 next to the executable and click the compile button at the bottom and the process will start.

However, there are a number of options available to you should you want to control your build process just a bit more.

# Building

Before compiling, make sure to click "Get Versions" and then select the version that matches with the mod's JARfile.

If The mod is version 1.18.2-1.0.0, you will select that in the build tool version.

Then press compile!
